  Description:
    Abstract:
      A joint venture involving the National Atlas programs in Canada (Natural 
      Resources Canada), Mexico (Instituto Nacional de Estadística Geografía e 
      Informática), and the United States (U.S. Geological Survey), as well as 
      the North American Commission for Environmental Co-operation, has led to 
      the release (June 2004) of several new products: an updated paper map of 
      North America, and its associated geospatial data sets and their metadata.  
      These data sets are available online from each of the partner countries 
      both for download. This data has been revised and re-released in 2006.

      The North American Atlas data are standardized geospatial data sets at 
      1:10,000,000 scale.  A variety of basic data layers (e.g. roads, 
      railroads, populated places, political boundaries, hydrography, 
      bathymetry, sea ice and glaciers) have been integrated so that their 
      relative positions are correct.  This collection of data sets forms a base 
      with which other North American thematic data may be integrated.  Any data 
      outside of Canada, Mexico, and the United States of America included in 
      the North American Atlas data sets is strictly to complete the context of 
      the data.

      The North American Atlas - Roads data set shows the roads of North America 
      at 1:10,000,000 scale.  The roads included in this data set are either 
      those that connect major centres of population or selected frontier roads.  
      Roads under construction are not shown.  There are three road classes: 
      Major roads, which are divided, multi-lane, limited access highways; 
      Secondary roads, which are all roads that do not meet the definition of 
      major roads; and Ferries, which are major ferry links which run either 
      year round or through periods when ice conditions permit.

      This data set was produced using digital files supplied by Natural 
      Resources Canada, Instituto Nacional de Estadística Geografía e 
      Informática, and the U.S. Geological Survey.

    Purpose:
      The North American Atlas data are intended for geographic display and 
      analysis at the national and continental level.  These data should be 
      displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:10,000,000-scale data.  
      No responsibility is assumed by Natural Resources Canada, Instituto 
      Nacional de Estadística Geografía e Informática, or the U.S. Geological 
      Survey in the use of these data. 
    
    Supplemental_Information:
      The Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC) is an international
      organization created by Canada, Mexico, and the United States of America 
      under the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC).  
      The CEC was established to address regional environmental concerns, help 
      prevent potential trade and environmental conflicts, and to promote the 
      effective enforcement of environmental law.  The Agreement complements the
      environmental provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement 
      (NAFTA).  Further information on the CEC is available from 
      http://www.cec.org/ or from

      All North American Atlas data sets are available in three data formats: 
      Arc/INFO Export format (e00), ArcView Shapefile, Geography Markup Language 
      (GML) and Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS). 

      Although these data are distributed in geographic coordinates, the North 
      American Atlas Map uses a Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection.  The 
      following parameters were used for the map:
      >Longitude_of_Projection_Center: -100.00 
      >Latitude_of_Projection_Center: 45.00 
      >False_Easting (metres): 0.0 
      >False_Northing (metres): 0.0 
      >Semi-major_Axis: 6370997.0 
      >Denominator_of_Flattening_Ratio: 1.0
      >Ellipsoid_Name: Sphere 
      >Units: metres

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: 
      Where possible, attribute data were quality controlled by creating 
      symbolized digital displays or hard copy plots, which were visually 
      verified with digital or hard copy reference data.  Attribute data that 
      could not be verified in such a manner were interactively queried to check 
      for anomalies such as duplication of data in fields requiring unique 
      values and incorrect feature coding.  Data for areas outside of Canada, 
      Mexico, and the United States of America are only provided for context;
      Natural Resources Canada, Instituto Nacional de Estadística Geografía e 
      Informática, and the U.S. Geological Survey assume no responsibility 
      for the completeness, accuracy, or presentation of this data.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: 
    A quality control of the linear road and ferry links data was done in order 
    to ensure topological consistency within each country and across country 
    boundaries.
  Completeness_Report:
    This data set includes roads and ferry links for all of North America as 
    shown at 1:10,000,000 scale.  The data completeness reflects the content of 
    the source data, the selection made by the cartographers, and the quality 
    control of the content performed by each country.
  Positional_Accuracy: 
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy: 
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: 
        Positional accuracy varies throughout the data.  Positions are dependent 
        on the accuracy of the source data and on the result of the 
        generalization and integration processes.  Data for areas outside of 
        Canada, Mexico, and the United States of America are only provided for 
        context; Natural Resources Canada, Instituto Nacional de Estadística 
        Geografía e Informática, and the U.S. Geological Survey assume no 
        responsibility for the completeness, accuracy, or presentation of this 
        data.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Linework from the 1:6,000,000 Atlas of Canada road network was 
        generalized and fitted to the North American Atlas hydrography and 
        populated places layers.  The 1:1,000,000 National Scale Frameworks Road 
        Network, Canada was used as a supplement to check selection and 
        position.  The attribute for the country was added to the data.

        Linework from the 1:5,000,000 United States General Reference Map was 
        generalized and fitted to the North American Atlas hydrography and 
        populated places layers.  The attribute for the country was added to the 
        data.

      Process_Description:
        Linework from the 1:4,000,000 Topographical Dataset for Mexico was 
        generalized and fitted to the North American Atlas hydrography and 
        populated places layers.  The attribute for the country was added to the 
        data.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Roads for regions outside Canada, Mexico, and the United States of 
        America were compiled from the 1:10,000,000 North America National Atlas 
        of Canada Reference Map Series data set.  Linework was fitted to the 
        North American Atlas hydrography and populated places layers.

      Process_Date: 2004

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        The files from the three countries were combined with the file for the 
        regions outside Canada, Mexico, and the United States of America and the 
        linework was cartographically adjusted along country boundaries to 
        ensure correct connection of the road network.
      Process_Date: 2004

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Because the linework came from several different sources and scales, a 
        final cartographic review was done to the full road network to ensure 
        cartographic compatibility at 1:10,000,000 scale.  Each country then 
        performed a final cartographic check to verify the selection and 
        position of the linework.  The attributes were also verified.
      Process_Date: 2004

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
Roads that either followed or were off-set from hydro features (rivers and lakes) and boundary lines in the United States were adjusted to fit the new hydro or boundary positions. The quality control of the data was performed in order to check the attributes and geometry, and to make corrections before release.
